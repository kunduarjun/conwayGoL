# This is a program created by Al Sweigart, who is the author of "Automating the Boring Stuff with Python."
# Al Sweigart demonstrated how to program this game through his YouTube channel. 
# I am simply following along to his YouTube video, as I am looking to populate my GitHub with more reposiitories.
# I will add comments onto this program, in order to demonstrate that I understand what was discussed in the video.
# This will also demonstrate that I understand the requirements to program this game.
